Known Issues
============

-  Since the scaling methods implemented so far scale by default over the mean
   values of the respective months, unrealistic long-term mean values may occur
   at the month transitions. This can be prevented either by selecting
   ``group='time.dayofyear'```. Alternatively, it is possible not to scale using
   long-term mean values, but using a 31-day interval, which takes the 31
   surrounding values over all years as the basis for calculating the mean
   values. This is not yet implemented in this module, but is available in the
   command-line tool `BiasAdjustCXX`_.
-  Using this module or especially Python to apply bias correction techniques on
   large data sets can be a very time-consuming task. So this module is more
   about showing how to apply different methods on climate data and maybe even
   to bias-correct small data sets. When it comes to large ensembles it is
   preferred to use the way more efficient tool `BiasAdjustCXX`_. A speed
   comparison between `python-cmethods`_, `BiasAdjustCXX`_, and `xclim`_ was
   made this `tool comparison`_. Since the development of python-cmethods is
   continuing, speed improvements have been done since the last bench.
