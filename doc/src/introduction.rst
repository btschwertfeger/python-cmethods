About
-----

This Python module and the provided data structures are designed to help
minimize discrepancies between modeled and observed climate data of different
time periods. Data from past periods are used to adjust variables from current
and future time series so that their distributional properties approximate
possible actual values.

In this way, for example, modeled data, which on average represent values that
are too cold, can be bias-corrected by applying an adjustment procedure. The
following figure shows the observed, the modeled, and the bias-corrected values.
It is directly visible that the delta adjusted time series
(:math:`T^{*DM}_{sim,p}`) are much more similar to the observed data
(:math:`T_{obs,p}`) than the raw modeled data (:math:`T_{sim,p}`).

Available Methods
-----------------

python-cmethods provides the following bias correction techniques:

- Linear Scaling
- Variance Scaling
- Delta Method
- Quantile Mapping
- Detrended Quantile Mapping
- Quantile Delta Mapping

Please refer to the official documentation for more information about these
methods as well as sample scripts:
https://python-cmethods.readthedocs.io/en/stable/

- Except for the variance scaling, all methods can be applied on stochastic and
  non-stochastic climate variables. Variance scaling can only be applied on
  non-stochastic climate variables.

  - Non-stochastic climate variables are those that can be predicted with relative
    certainty based on factors such as location, elevation, and season. Examples
    of non-stochastic climate variables include air temperature, air pressure, and
    solar radiation.

  - Stochastic climate variables, on the other hand, are those that exhibit a high
    degree of variability and unpredictability, making them difficult to forecast
    accurately. Precipitation is an example of a stochastic climate variable
    because it can vary greatly in timing, intensity, and location due to complex
    atmospheric and meteorological processes.

- Except for the detrended quantile mapping (DQM) technique, all methods can be
  applied to 1- and 3-dimensional data sets. The implementation of DQM to
  3-dimensional data is still in progress.

- For any questions -- please open an issue at https://github.com/btschwertfeger/python-cmethods/issues
Examples can be found in the `python-cmethods`_ repository and of course
within this documentation.
