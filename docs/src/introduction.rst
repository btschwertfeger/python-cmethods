About
-----

This Python module and the provided data structures are designed
to help minimize discrepancies between modeled and observed climate data of different
time periods. Data from past periods are used to adjust variables
from current and future time series so that their distributional
properties approximate possible actual values.

In this way, for example, modeled data, which on average represent values
that are too cold, can be bias-corrected by applying an adjustment procedure.
The following figure shows the observed, the modeled, and the bias-corrected values.
It is directly visible that the delta adjusted time series
(:math:`T^{*DM}_{sim,p}`) are much more similar to the observed data (:math:`T_{obs,p}`)
than the raw modeled data (:math:`T_{sim,p}`).

Available Methods
-----------------

The following bias correction techniques are available:
    Scaling-based techniques:
        * Linear Scaling :func:`cmethods.CMethods.linear_scaling`
        * Variance Scaling :func:`cmethods.CMethods.variance_scaling`
        * Delta (change) Method :func:`cmethods.CMethods.delta_method`

    Distribution-based techniques:
        * Quantile Mapping :func:`cmethods.CMethods.quantile_mapping`
        * Quantile Delta Mapping :func:`cmethods.CMethods.quantile_delta_mapping`

All of these methods are intended to be applied on 1-dimensional time-series climate data.
This module also provides the function :func:`cmethods.CMethods.adjust_3d` that enables
the application of the desired bias correction method on 3-dimensinoal data sets.

Except for the variance scaling, all methods can be applied on stochastic and non-stochastic
climate variables. Variance scaling can only be applied on non-stochastic climate variables.

- Stochastic climate variables are those that are subject to random fluctuations
  and are not predictable. They have no predictable trend or pattern. Examples of
  stochastic climate variables include precipitation, air temperature, and humidity.

- Non-stochastic climate variables, on the other hand, have clear trend and pattern histories
  and can be readily predicted. They are often referred to as climate elements and include
  variables such as water temperature and air pressure.

Examples can be found in the `python-cmethods`_ repository and of course
within this documentation.
